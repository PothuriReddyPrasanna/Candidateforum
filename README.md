# Candidateforum
Candidate Forum is a social media platform meant for the interaction between the public and the candidates contesting in the elections. The citizens who vote, are not well-informed about the candidates. The reason is the lack of a dedicated platform for this purpose. This website allows the public to search for the list of candidates contesting in their constituency. The profile of the Candidate contains statuses they upload everyday regarding any public matter. This way the opinions and ideas of the candidates are always shared with the public. The public can even get a verified bio-data and history of the candidate. &lt;br> The objective of this website is to make people more aware of the candidates and their interests, so that people elect based on the information provided to them, rather than just solely based on the party name.
